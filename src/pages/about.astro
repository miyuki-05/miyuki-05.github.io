    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Based in Sydney, Australia, I'm a current student at UNSW studying to learn more about varying topics and enhance my own knowledge.</p>
    <p>I have a strong depth of knowledge in many computer languages ranging from Python and C to Java, Javascript and R.</p>
    <p>I also have experience working on personal projects in relation to statistical analysis, stocks (options and futures) as well as neural networks and AI.</p>
