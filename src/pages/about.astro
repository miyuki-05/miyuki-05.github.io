    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Based in Sydney, Australia, I'm a current student at UNSW studying to learn more about varying topics and enhance my own knowledge.</p>
    <p> I have a strong depth of knowledge in many computer languages ranging from Python and C to Java, Javascript and R.</p>
    <p> I am also fluent in both English and Mandarin as well as having basic knowledge of Japanese.</p>
    <p> I also have experience working on personal projects in relation to statistical analysis, stocks (options and futures) as well as neural networks and AI.</p>
    <p> I am extremely passionate about improving my own understanding of certain concepts especially within the AI and statistics areas.
        I work well in both collaborative and self-enforced learning as I like to understand where other people's ideas are grounded.</p>
